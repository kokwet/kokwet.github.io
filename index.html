                                    <p >Kokwet CBO believes in education as the key to eradication of poverty. Our education programs have revolved around motivating students and increasing access to primary and secondary schools within our community. These programs have been established to curb school dropouts, unmotivated students and parents and poverty within the community that prevents many students from affording primary and secondary education.
We work with the government, non-profit organizations and the community in providing bursaries, awarding scholarships and fundraising for needy students, especially the girl child. We have also mobilized the community in providing resources to support government efforts in establishing local schools.

                                    <p>Good health and flourishing communities go hand in hand. We envision a community that makes informed health choices. As such our health programs have focused on preventive health care and wellness. Kokwet CBO educates the community members on hygiene, nutrition and raises awareness on access to medical care. We focus on school children as they are most vulnerable and women as they are the primary caretakers in most homes. We also strive to address the problem of water and sanitation in our communities through community mobilization and advocacy and partnership with government and NGOs.</p>

                                    <h3>Women Empowerment</h3>
                                    <p>Kokwet CBO believes that empowering women is a sustainable means of eradicating poverty in our community. We recognize that women are the primary breadwinners and caretakers in many homes in our community. The well being of families, children and homes is therefore dependent on them. Empowered women would result in better children healthcare, better-educated children, well-nourished children and happy homes in general. We partner with women groups to hold programs to educate parents and help build their capacity to better take care of their homes.</p>

                                    <h3>Ecomomic Empowerment</h3>
                                    <p>Our economic related programs revolve around agriculture and small businesses. Most families make their income from these two activities. Our goal is to help community members diversify their agricultural produce and learn about the best agricultural practices to improve their yields. We also hope to help community members access financial services for the benefit of their business. Ultimately, we hope that an increase in the income of community members will promote education, health and their overall well-being and reduced conflicts.</p>

                                <p>With rural setting and distant from major towns, Kapkoros area has limited infrastructure. There is one gravelled road, three public and two private primary schools, two new secondary schools, one dispensary and two dams. Government projects yet to be completed include a bore hole and a cattle dip. There are also plans underway to supply electricity. Currently, residents fetch water from dams which is rarely treated.</p>
                                <p>The area is a lowland with black cotton soil and has a few rocky mountains with red volcanic soil and natural forests. These make the area good for agriculture however, poor agricultural practices and destructions of forests is quickly degrading the environment </p>
