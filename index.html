                                <p>Kokwet CBO believes that education is key to eradication of poverty in our community. As such, It is at the core of our programs and has revolved around motivating students and parents and increasing access to primary and secondary education. We work with the government, non-profit organizations and the community in providing bursaries, awarding scholarships and fundraising for needy students, especially the girl child. We also mobilize the community in providing resources to support government efforts in establishing local schools.

We recognize that women are the primary breadwinners and caretakers in many homes in our community. Empowered women would result in better social, health and economic status of families, children and the community. We partner with women groups to hold capacity building, gender advocacy and awareness programs.</p>

                                <p>Our economic related programs revolve around agriculture and small businesses. Most families make their income from these two activities. We help community members diversify their agricultural produce and learn about the best agricultural practices to improve their yields.

                                <p>With rural setting and distant from major towns, Kapkoros area has limited infrastructure. There is one gravelled road, three public and two private primary schools, two new secondary schools, one dispensary and two dams. Government projects yet to be completed include a bore hole and a cattle dip. There are also plans underway to supply electricity. Currently, residents fetch water from dams which is rarely treated.</p>
                                <p>The area is a lowland with black cotton soil and has a few rocky mountains with red volcanic soil and natural forests. These make the area good for agriculture however, poor agricultural practices and destructions of forests is quickly degrading the environment </p>

This is why we started Kokwet CBO. Holding field days in schools has been one of our successful programs. In 2014, we had five field in schools. We held motivational talks and covered health education namely sanitation and hygiene, nutrition, de-worming of students, H.I.V/Aids awareness and discouraged FGM, early pregnancies and early marriages. Through such programs, we will continue to work to eradicate poverty in our community.”
