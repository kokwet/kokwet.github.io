Our community consists of local residents, friends and partners commited to improve the living standards of people of Kapkoros area. Kapkoros area lies under the administrative unit Kapkoros sublocation in Trans Mara East District in Narok County, Kenya. The area is about 60km from the famous Maasai Mara game reserved.

Our community gets its name 'kokwet' from the local language. In a traditional setting, the 'kokwet' was the a significant economic and social unit in within community. The term is now colloquially used to mean 'neighbourhood'. Here is some quick information about our people, area and partners.

People:

Kapkoros area has about 7500 people and about 17 square km in size. The residents derive their income from farming and small businesses. The main cash crop is maize, tomatoes, sweat potatoes and beans even though it is in small scale. Income from small business like sale of milk,
vegetables, chicken, and livestock, charcoal trade and wage labour supplement income from cash crops. As such, perennial famine hurts the livelihood of households with majority of homes living on one meal a day. 

Women are the main bread winners here as many men indulge in alcohol.

About 70% of Kapkoros inhabitants are illiterate. Few make it to secondary school because of lack fees and a large number of those who do drop out.


Area:

Kapkoros area is in a rural setting and has limited infrastructure. There is one gravelled road, 3 public primary schools and two private, two new secondary schools, one dispensary and two dams. Government projects yet to be completed include a borehole and a cattle dip. There are also plans underway to supply electricity. Currently, residents fetch water from dams which is rarely treated. This contributes and poor sanitation contributes to water borne diseases.

The environment is good for farming but erratic weather hurts agricultural activities.
